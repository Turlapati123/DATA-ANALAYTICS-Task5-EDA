 The objective is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the given dataset, extract meaningful insights, and present them with visualizations and statistical summaries.

Data Cleaning
   - Handled missing values.
   - Adjusted data types where necessary.
   - Removed irrelevant/duplicate entries.

Univariate Analysis
   - Histograms and boxplots to understand feature distributions.
   - Value counts for categorical variables.

Bivariate Analysis
   - Scatterplots and bar plots to examine relationships.
   - Grouped summaries for key features.

Multivariate Analysis
   - Correlation matrix using `.corr()`.
   - Heatmap to visualize correlations.
   - Pairplot for visual pairwise relationships.
     
Insights & Observations
   - Key patterns and trends identified.
   - Relationship between survival rates and features.
   - Detected anomalies or outliers.
   
Visualizations Used
- **Histograms** â€“ Distribution of numerical features.
- **Boxplots** â€“ Outlier detection.
- **Scatterplots** â€“ Relationship between two numerical features.
- **Heatmaps** â€“ Correlation between features.
- **Pairplots** â€“ Multiple relationships at once.

Findings Summary
- Survival rates were higher among certain passenger classes and genders.
- Strong correlation between `fare` and `passenger class`.
- Missing values in `age` and `cabin` required handling.
- Fare distribution was positively skewed.
